    <ul id="instructions">
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, salt and yeast. Pour in warm water and stir mixture with a wooden spoon
        until a shaggy ball forms (you can add a little more water or a little more flour if you feel it needs it).</li>
        <li>Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allow to rise for 12 - 18 hours (on the counter at room temperature).</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 450 degrees. Once oven has reached 450 degrees, place an enameled cast iron pot covered with lid into
        preheated oven, heat pot for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, turn dough out onto a well floured surface, or onto a floured sheet of parchment paper (oven safe to 450)
        then shape dough into a ball. Cover shaped dough with an extra large bowl and allow to rest while pot is heating, about
        30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pot from oven and with floured hands, or holding the corners of the parchment paper, carefully drop dough into
        hot pot (you don't need to grease the pot). Immediately cover with lid, then return pot to oven and bake 30 minutes (at
        450 degrees).</li>
        <li>After 30 minutes, remove lid from pot and bake uncovered for 12 - 15 minutes until nicely golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and allow bread to cool on a cooling rack before slicing.</li>
